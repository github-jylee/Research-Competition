# Research-Competition
This is an SNS text mining of Yonsei Facebook page, which is an annonymous website where students can freely discuss topics.
I have crawled 300 top most liked posts on Yonsei Facebook page (대나무숲 http://yonsei.fbpage.kr/#/search).


The purpose of this reserach is to analyse communication styles, interests, concerns of Yonsei students.

First, I used word cloud to analyse word frequency. Second, I used network analysis to evaluate the relationships between the words.
Lastly, I used topic modelling (LDA) to find out which topics are mostly discussed online. All of the findings were compared based on sentimental analysis.

Results
1. Word Frequency
The result indicates that Yonsei students refer to their parents and friends the most.
The most frequent words were as follows:
1. 사람(person) 2. 엄마 (mother), 3. 친구 (friend) for positive posts,
1. 미안(sorriness) 2. 엄마 (mother), 3. 아빠 (father) for neutral posts,
1. 사람 (person) 2. 생각 (thought) 3. 엄마 (mother) for negative posts.
From the result, it can be inferred that relationship is a key concern for Yonsei students.

2. Network Analysis
I have furthered the word frequency result via network analysis to find out the relationship between the word patterns.

3. LDA topic modelling
